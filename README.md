# Probability

This repository focuses on probability distributions, inferential statistics, and their real-world applications through case studies and practice exercises. The notebooks provide a comprehensive understanding of probability concepts, statistical methods, and their implementations and applying statistical techniques in data analysis.

### This repository includes:

* Detailed explanations of probability distributions (Binomial, Normal, Uniform, etc.).
* Practical notebooks to understand key statistical concepts like the Central Limit Theorem and confidence intervals.
* Real-world case studies to apply statistical methods to solve business problems.

**1.** __*Probability Distributions*__
Learn about various probability distributions and their characteristics with interactive examples:

**a.** __*Binomial Distribution.ipynb:*__ 
* Explains the discrete probability distribution for scenarios with two outcomes (success/failure).
* Includes real-world examples such as coin tosses and quality control. <br>
**b.** __*Normal Distribution.ipynb:*__
* Focuses on the bell-shaped curve, its properties, and applications.
* Covers concepts such as mean, standard deviation, and the 68-95-99.7 rule. <br>
**c.** __*Uniform Distribution.ipynb:*__
* Explores both discrete and continuous uniform distributions.
* Includes visualizations and practical examples. <br>
**d.** __*pdf&cdf:*__
